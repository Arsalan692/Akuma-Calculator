# 🖩 Akuma Calculator

This is a **basic calculator GUI** I built years ago using Python’s `tkinter` library.  
It features a custom design, manual button placement, and basic error handling.  

⚠️ **Note:**  
This is an **old project** uploaded just for **fun and learning**. It’s not optimized or production-ready.
